# Diamond-Demo

This project was made to demonstrate recursion. 

Diamond Maker 1, takes in the diamond length, prints out the current line, then uses the recursion to call the method again
after decrementing length

Diamond Maker 2, takes in the diamond length, calls Diamond Maker (length -1), then prints, so the first thing printed is actually
line 1, rather than line length #

More code at the end demonstrating recursion with numbers
